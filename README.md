lsp: list files in mildly more readable format
===



`lsp` is like [`ls`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls) command
but does not attempt to meet
the archaic POSIX specification, so instead of this:
```
(bash)$ ls -l

total 16

```

you get this:

```
  $ lsp

  ... something fancy
  (actually I did not come up with what is it going to look like yet)
```
which is arguably more readable.

This tool is dedicated to the lifetime of achievement of my personal hero and muse, the one with the nicest LUMPS,
the [Lumpy Space Princess](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lumpy_Space_Princess) (LSP).
